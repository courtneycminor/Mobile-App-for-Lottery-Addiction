# Mobile-App-for-Lottery-Addiction
Created the logic for a mobile app that helps individuals with a gambling addiction for a hypothetical medical institute using Probability theory. The mobile app will help patients better estimate their chances of winning the lottery with one or multiple tickets, and the chance of smaller winnings with matching numbers between 2 to 5.

This was a guided project from DATAQUEST Probability: Fundamentals Course.
